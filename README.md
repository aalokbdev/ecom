This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

# Product Cards App

## Overview

This is a React Native application that showcases a list of products in a card format with animations. The app allows users to view product details, purchase products, and see a cart containing recent purchases.

---

## Features

- Display products in an engaging card format with smooth animations.
- Purchase products and add them to the cart.
- View recently purchased products (from the last two days) in a dedicated cart screen.
- Optimized for performance and smooth rendering of product lists.

---

## Step 1: Environment Setup  ---

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions to run and test the project.


## Step 2: Clone the repository

   - git clone <repository-url>
   - cd <project-directory>


## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run your React Native App.
